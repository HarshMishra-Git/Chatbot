## Problem Statement

In todayâ€™s digital age, providing instant and accurate responses to user queries is crucial for enhancing user experience across various domains. However, many existing chatbot solutions struggle to effectively understand user intent and extract relevant entities, leading to unsatisfactory interactions. This project aims to develop a chatbot using NLP techniques and Logistic Regression to accurately classify intents and extract entities from user input. The project also seeks to create an intuitive web interface for seamless user interaction using Streamlit.

## Solution

The proposed solution is an intent-based chatbot built using NLP techniques and a Logistic Regression model for intent classification and entity extraction. The solution is implemented in the following steps:

- **Intent Detection and Entity Extraction**: Use labeled datasets to train a Logistic Regression model for classifying user intents. Implement NLP preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Interactive Chatbot Interface**: Build an intuitive web-based interface using Streamlit to facilitate user interaction. Integrate the trained model to process user inputs in real-time and generate appropriate responses.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Display a dynamic chat window for smooth interaction between users and the chatbot. Provide meaningful and accurate responses by leveraging the trained model and NLP techniques.
- **Scalability and Customization**: Allow for easy addition of new intents and entities to extend chatbot capabilities. Enable integration with more advanced models and techniques, such as deep learning, for improved performance.

This solution bridges the gap between user expectations and chatbot performance, creating a reliable, scalable, and interactive conversational platform.

## Improvements Implemented
